       <p>There have been cases, that, believe it or not, have caused relationships to end or stirred feelings of jealousy and inner insecurity just because of a simple post. According to Pew Research Center, 34% of 18-19 year olds have shared mixed feelings and thoughts of jealousy because of their partners habits or reactions to other users on Social Media. Even an accidental or intentional like from an Ex has caused partners to snap onto their significant others. </p>

       <p> While Social Media has it's perks with being able to display the results of certain products, this backfires when used by the wrong people. Companies and "Entrepreneurs" will use this to their advantage, creating a barrier or unrealistic standards for the viewer. Even expectations for said product. Here are a few examples:</p>
       <li>  Beauty Products </li>
       <li>  Acne Treatment </li>
        <li> Even Filters</li>
        </li>

       <p>Now, with all of that said, the ways to solve this issue is by doing your research before posting or spreading anything online in order to avoid false information. Another way is by not taking everything on the internet serious. </p>
